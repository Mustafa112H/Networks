                <p class="paragraph">
                    The image illustrates the components of nodal delay in a packet-switched network as a packet moves
                    through Router A to its destination. The process begins with nodal processing, where the router examines
                    the packet header, performs routing decisions, and checks for errors. Next is the queueing delay, which
                    occurs if the outgoing link is busy, causing packets to wait in a queue; the extent of this delay
                    depends on network congestion and the number of packets ahead. Following this, the transmission delay
                    occurs as the router transmits the packet onto the link, determined by the packet size and link
                    bandwidth. Finally, the propagation delay is the time it takes for the packet to travel across the
                    physical link to the next node, depending on the distance between the nodes and the medium's propagation
                    speed.
